With suicide now an international epidemic, one outburst could land her in The Program, the only proven course of treatment. Sloane’s parents have already lost one child; Sloane knows they’ll do anything to keep her alive. She also knows that everyone who’s been through The Program returns as a blank slate. Because their depression is gone—but so are their memories.Under constant surveillance at home and at school, Sloane puts on a brave face and keeps her feelings buried as deep as she can.

He is overcome with the eerie sense that he knows this man...that the storyteller is not an Indian at all but an old school friend, Saul Zuratas. As recollections of Zuratas flow through his mind, the writer begins to imagine Zuratas's transformation from a modern to a central member of the unacculturated Machiguenga tribe. Weaving the mysteries of identity, storytelling, and truth, Vargas Llosa has created a spellbinding tale of one man's journey from the modern world to our origins, abandoning one in order to find meaning in both.","Picador","http://c.cheggcdn.com/covers2/120000/123582_1307134147.jpg","Hardcover","1st edition"]}}],"does_the_book_description_sufficiently_describe_the_same_given_book":{"agg":"yes","confidence":0.8253968253968252}}}

Sage Singer is a baker. She works through the night, preparing the day's breads and pastries, trying to escape a reality of loneliness, bad memories, and the shadow of her mother's death. When Josef Weber, an elderly man in Sage's grief support group, begins stopping by the bakery, they strike up an unlikely friendship. Despite their differences, they see in each other the hidden scars that others can't, and they become companions. Everything changes on the day that Josef confesses a long-buried and shameful secret--one that nobody else in town would ever suspect--and asks Sage for an extraordinary favor. If she says yes, she faces not only moral repercussions, but potentially legal ones as well. With her own identity suddenly challenged, and the integrity of the closest friend she's ever had clouded, Sage begins to question the assumptions and expectations she's made about her life and her family. When does a moral choice become a moral imperative? And where does one draw the line between punishment and justice, forgiveness and mercy? In this searingly honest novel, Jodi Picoult gracefully explores the lengths we will go in order to protect our families and to keep the past from dictating the future.","Atria/Emily Bestler Books","03/14/13","https://www.bookshare.org/cms/legal-information","Bookshare.org","English","Literature and Fiction","Jodi Picoult","2013"]},"judgments_count":6,"state":"finalized","agreement":0.833333333333333,"missed_count":0,"gold_pool":null,"created_at":"2016-09-12T15:39:17+00:00","updated_at":"2016-09-13T08:36:58+00:00","job_id":949953,"results":{"judgments":[{"id":2118719941,"created_at":"2016-09-13T08:22:36+00:00","started_at":"2016-09-13T08:19:12+00:00","acknowledged_at":null,"external_type":"elite","golden":false,"missed":null,"rejected":null,"tainted":false,"country":"PHL","region":"63","city":"","job_id":949953,"unit_id":1035731192,"worker_id":38390121,"trust":1.0,"worker_trust":0.825,"unit_state":"finalized","data":{"does_the_book_description_sufficiently_describe_the_same_given_book":"no","_clicks":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Storyteller_(novel)"]},"unit_data":{"query":"The Storyteller (novel)","wikipage":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Storyteller_(novel)","subject_id":"node329ebf83e5457461b3613318649f712_<https://www.bookshare.org/browse/book/624390?returnPath=L2Jyb3dzZS9wb3B1bGFyP21vZHVsZU5hbWU9cHVibGljJm9mZnNldD0yNQ%3D%3D>","predicates":["name","author","isbn","description","publisher","datePublished","license","provider","inLanguage","keywords","copyrightHolder","copyrightYear"],"objects":["The Storyteller","Jodi Picoult","9781439149706","Some stories live forever . . .

How did an obscure personality cult come to be the world's biggest religion, with a third of humanity its followers? This book, now the most comprehensive and up to date single volume work in English, describes not only the main facts, ideas and personalities of Christian history, its organization and spirituality, but how it has changed politics, sex, and human society. Taking in wars, empires, reformers, apostles, sects, churches and crusaders, Diarmaid MacCulloch shows how Christianity has brought humanity to the most terrible acts of cruelty - and inspired its most sublime accomplishments. \"A stunning tour de force\". (Simon Sebag Montefiore, \"Sunday Telegraph\" Books of the Year). \"A landmark in its field, astonishing in its range, compulsively readable, full of insight...It will have few, if any, rivals in the English language\". (Rowan Williams, Archbishop of Canterbury, \"Guardian\"). \"A prodigious, thrilling, masterclass of a history book\". (John Cornwell, \"Financial Times\").\"Essential reading for those enthralled by Christianity and for those enraged by it\". (Melvyn Bragg, \"Observer\", Books of the Year). \"Magnificent ...a sumptuous portrait, alive with detail and generous in judgement\". (Richard Holloway, \"The Times\"). Diarmaid MacCulloch is Professor of the History of the Church at Oxford University. His \"Thomas Cranmer\" won the Whitbread Biography Prize, the James Tait Black Prize and the Duff Cooper Prize.
